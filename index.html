<span class="c2">Re: Protecting the City&rsquo;s Ordinance Climate Equity Fund in the FY 2025 Budget </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2">Honorable Mayor Gloria, </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">We, constituents of the City of San Diego, united members of the Black and African Women Rise Democratic Club along with various allied clubs, groups, and organizations cannot over emphasize enough the importance of safeguarding the City of San Diego&rsquo;s equity programs, underscoring the Climate Equity Fund ordinance and its original intent. During a time when thousands of San Diego residents experienced the worst flood impacts on record, the City of San Diego should leverage all possible resources to help uplift our community, not take away from it. The restoration of homes and neighborhoods is a monumental task, and the City of San Diego&rsquo;s unanimous approval of the Climate Equity Fund ordinance on March 11, 2021, aligns with its responsibility and within its authority to address residents remaining needs from the devastating floods consistent with California&rsquo;s Senate Bill 1000 passed in 2016. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">There should be no debate on where the approximately $8.5 million Climate Equity Fund is allocated, considering the excessive, ongoing significant needs resulting from the widespread devastation caused by the floods impacting thousands of constituents in San Diego. According to California Senate Bill 1000, cities are required to have an Environmental Justice policy in their General Plan. Additionally, California Government Code section 65302(h)(4)(A), defines &ldquo;disadvantage communities&rdquo; pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 39711 or a low-income area that is disproportionately affected by environmental pollution and other hazards that can lead to negative health effects, exposure, or environmental degradation. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is a Call To-Action urging our City leaders to prioritize and address the needs of constituents in the upcoming budget and demonstrate accountable governance. The Climate Equity Fund is an integrated resource designed to alleviate the effects of climate change for the under-resourced communities. To defund the City&rsquo;s Climate Equity Fund, a designated resource for Communities of Concern that clearly have outstanding needs from recent climate impacts, and identified within the City&rsquo;s Climate Equity Index, runs counter to the City of San Diego&rsquo;s Environment Committee core principles, which are: </span></p><ul class="c8 lst-kix_se6m92p6k1r1-0 start"><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Advance ambitious climate goals. </span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Lead with equity.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Acknowledge past harm and need for environmental justice. </span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Ensure transparency and promote inclusion. </span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Ensure high quality job standards while expanding a skilled and trained workforce for a green economy. </span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Partner with government agencies and community organizations to improve strategies and leverage resources. </span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c2">According to the City&rsquo;s Climate Equity Index, it largely represents city council districts 4, 8, and 9, which have the most diverse residents respectively. Notably these districts were at the epicenter of the devastating floods on January 22, 2024. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The overwhelming outstanding needs that remain indicates the need to enforce the City&rsquo;s Climate Equity Fund for its intended purpose. This entails directly addressing the existing impacts. Any deviation from this course represents a clear act of climate justice resistance, rather than advancing the strategies, and leveraging resource utilization outlined in the 2024 Environment Committee Work Plan. We urge you to honor the City&rsquo;s ordinance regarding the Climate Equity Fund, and for the City of San Diego to continue to make targeted investments in these communities, as originally intended. The investments from the City&rsquo;s Climate Equity Fund for FY 2025 will bolster climate change resilience for the communities within the City&rsquo;s Climate Equity Index spanning from 0 up to 60.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Our city is made up of people, each with their own stories, challenges, and aspirations. The proposed budget cuts would not be benign, yet it would threaten to inflict lasting harm on the lives of our residents. Therefore, we ask that all equity programs continue to be funded for fiscal year 2025. It is imperative that you maintain support and continue to fund the following programs;</span></p><ul class="c8 lst-kix_l6qiz5p2ndfc-0 start"><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Climate Equity Fund:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Resolution R &ndash; 2021 &ndash; 313454, ordinance passed March 11, 2021. </span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">After-School Programs:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;17 sites would be impacted with After-school and Teen Center programs.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Office of Child and Youth Success Programming:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Programs include college and career readiness workshops, and community outreach for women of color. </span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Youth Drop-in Centers:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Previously approved funding for mental health counseling, trauma-informed care, jobs skills and youth development activities.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Eviction Prevention Program:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Program underscores California&rsquo;s recent approved legislation SB 567, The Homeless Prevention Act.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Eviction Notice Registry:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Resolution passed in May 2023, is a requirement of the Tenant Protection ordinance.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Community Equity Fund in the Office of Race and Equity: </span><span class="c2">Provides grants to community-based organizations addressing racial equity projects in the city.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Cannabis Equity Program: </span><span class="c2">Eliminating this program would require the City of San Diego to return $900,000 to the state of California. </span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">SD Access 4 All Digital Equity Program: </span><span class="c2">Program helps mitigate the digital divide. </span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Library Staff: </span><span class="c2">Library staff cut would impact over 10 full time positions. </span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Office of Immigrant Affairs: </span><span class="c2">Eliminating this office will impact resources needed for immigrants.</span></li><li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Community, Projects, Programs &amp; Services:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Funds several grassroots nonprofit organizations that is vital for their operations to serve the community. &nbsp;</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c2">As constituents, we insist that our needs are prioritized and are firmly entrenched in the City&rsquo;s fiscal budget for 2025. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Regards, </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Alyce Pipkin-Allen, Founder &amp; Co-President, Black and African Women Rise Democratic Club </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Sonja Robinson, Principal Consultant, Resolution Specialist | Chief Equity Officer, Sustainable Urban Network LLC </span></p>
